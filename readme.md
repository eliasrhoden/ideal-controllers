# Ideal controllers for simple systems

Often when you design and optimize the control parameters you perform an optimization in relation with a nonlinear simulation or nonlinear objective.


These methods often require an *inital guess* of the *optimial* control gains. Here are some solutions for 

* First order system (PT1) - PI Controller
* Second order system (PT2) - PID Controller

For these systems there exists an analytical solution to the control gains that achieve a desired bandwidth.
