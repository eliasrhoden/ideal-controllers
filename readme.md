# Ideal controllers for simple systems

Often when you design and optimize the control parameters you perform an optimization in relation with a nonlinear simulation or nonlinear objective.

These methods often require an *inital guess* of the *optimial* control gains. Here are a solution for 

* First order system (PT1) - PI Controller
